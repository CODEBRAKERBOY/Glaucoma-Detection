## Problem Statement -
Glaucoma is one of the main cause of blindness and is irreversible. Caused by elevated intraocular pressure, it do harm to optic nerve head which sends images to your brain. Glaucoma result in structure change of optic disk and cup. most people with glaucoma have no early symptoms or pain. WHO has estimated that 4.5 million people are blind due to glaucoma. In India, at least 12 million people affected and nearly 1.2 million people blind from the disease. More than 90 percent of cases of glaucoma remain undiagnosed in the community. There is no cure (yet) for glaucoma, but if itâ€™s caught early, you can preserve your vision. we can prevent vision loss by the **measurement of cup-to-disk diameter ratio(CDR)** in retinal images to detect glaucoma. CDR greater than 0.65 is seen as the symbol of glaucomatous in clinical practice.
